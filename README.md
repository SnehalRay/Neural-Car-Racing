# Neural-Car-Racing
This is a project from our NATHACKS hackathon where we build a car racing game using the Muse 2. The way this game works is that we use the muse 2 to capture our concentration/focus level for the acceleration. The more the focus, the higher is the acceleration.
We even used gyroscope and accelerometer readings to determine the movement of the car.
As you tilt your head to the right, the car will move right and if you tilt your head to the left, the car will move left.
This game even has a NetCode feature which means, you can play the game in Multiplayer with your friends and family, with the Muse 2 headset

Objective of the game: To make a fun game out of focus level as we train our focus level to improve more and more in the form of a game.
